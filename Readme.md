WORDLE <br />
Wordle, players have chances to guess a word(five to nine letter) in English. Three different types of feedback are possible for the player after each attempt: green indicates that the letter is in the right place, yellow indicates that the letter is in the wrong place, and gray indicates that the letter is missing from the answer. When the players get the word correctly, they win.

[Game Features](#Game_Feature)
1. Permitting sharing without ruining <br />

Sharing on social media is undoubtedly essential for becoming well-known and going viral, but Wordle's sharing feature is excellent. Although they won't be aware of the word of the day, your connections and followers can still see that you played the game today and how you performed. Using the color-block emojis, Wordle has come up with a classy way for users to easily share their gameplay without disclosing the solution

2. Ensuring simple accessibility <br />

Wordle is an easily accessible web game that can be played on any device with a browser. The players always have an easy and hassle-free experience, no matter what device they use. The player can just click the link and begin playing; they are not required to register or provide any information.

3. Making things seem scarce

For one day, just one modest goal. Players are left anticipating the next puzzle because there is a sense of scarcity when there is only one per day. On the Wordle screen, is there a countdown that you've noticed? I think this is a habit-forming strategy that makes players want to solve the next puzzle right away. Wake up, share, wordle, and get your day started!

4. Creating a feeling of accomplishment

You feel like you accomplished something with each guess. It appears green if the letter is in the proper place. Correct letters that are positioned incorrectly appear yellow. A letter appears gray if it is not present anywhere in the word. As a result, you are aware of your progress and inspired to finish the puzzle. The total number of games you played, your winning percentage, the length of your current streak, and your longest streak will all be displayed on your statistics board.

5. Maintaining simplicity

You will agree that this game's user interface is clutter-free if you have played it at least once. The secret to Wordle's success is usability, not beauty. All you need to complete the puzzle and win the game are the girds, the letters you typed, and your accurate guesses.  It fulfills its purpose! It has only the items a player needs to see to solve a puzzle, and it is fairly self-explanatory.
